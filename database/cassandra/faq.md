# **Can Two Nodes Store the Same Data in Cassandra?**  

Yes! Cassandra allows **both data replication and partitioning**, which means:  

---

## **1. Two Nodes Can Have the Same Data (Replication)**  

- If the **Replication Factor (RF) is 2 or more**, Cassandra copies the same data to multiple nodes.  
- This ensures **fault tolerance** and **high availability**.  
- **Example:**  
  - If **RF = 3**, the same data is stored on **3 different nodes**.  
  - Even if one node fails, the data is still accessible from the others.

## **2. Two Nodes Can Have Parts of the Same Data (Partitioning)**  

- Cassandra **splits large datasets into partitions** and distributes them across nodes.  
- A single dataset can have **different pieces stored on different nodes**.  
- **Example:**  
  - **User 123’s data might be split** across nodes:  
    - **Node A** → Stores profile info  
    - **Node B** → Stores messages  
    - **Node C** → Stores settings

## **Summary**  

| Scenario | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Replication** | The same data is stored on multiple nodes (for fault tolerance). |
| **Partitioning** | A dataset is split, and different nodes store different parts of it. |
